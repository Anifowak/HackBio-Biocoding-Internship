**Project: Age Prediction in Humans**

Study the data [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/methylation.data.csv]

- There are 1000 CpG sites to be used to determine the age of 108 individuals (Homo sapiens)
- Using any regression model, predict the age of the patients (last columns)
- In your feature selection step, reduce the number of features to select to 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10. How does the MSE behave with the reducing number of features?
- Generate a plot of the number of features against the mse values
