**Project 1: Age Prediction in Humans**

Study the data [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/methylation.data.csv]

- There are 1000 CpG sites to be used to determine the age of 108 individuals (Homo sapiens)
- Using any regression model, predict the age of the patients (last columns)
- In your feature selection step, reduce the number of features to select to 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10. How does the MSE behave with the reducing number of features?
- Generate a plot of the number of features against the mse values

**Project 2: Anatomy and Physiology [Cancer]**

Dataset [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-in-Biotechnology-and-Life-Sciences/refs/heads/main/datasets/dataset_wisc_sd.csv]

- How do you distinguish benign from malignant datasets?
- Using PCA and K-Mean clustering, classify and cluster the patients.
- Do you think there are other subclasses within the dataset?

**Project 3: Anatomy and Physiology [Diabetes]**

Dataset [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/diabetes.csv]

- The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
- Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?
- The last column contains the disease classification outcome
